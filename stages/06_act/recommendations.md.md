# Cyclistic Stakeholder Presentation

## 🔸 Business Task

**Goal:** Increase the number of annual memberships by understanding how casual riders and members differ in usage behavior.

## 🔷 Summary of Key Insights

### Key Insights and Takeaways to Increase Conversion from Casual Riders to Members

* Members ride nearly twice as often as casual users.

* Casual riders prefer longer, leisure-oriented trips; members make shorter, commute-driven rides.

* Weekend usage is dominated by casuals, while members are more active on weekdays — making **weekend-focused offers** effective for converting casuals.

* Few casuals ride early in the morning on weekdays, but those who do take short trips — similar to members — indicating a commuting purpose. **Early-morning weekday offers** could effectively convert this group.

* To reach the broader casual base, emphasize **long-ride benefits on classic bikes** during weekends, daytime, and evenings.

* Classic bikes are the most-used vehicle — marketing efforts should prioritize them.

* Casuals are taking shorter rides on weekdays, signaling potential for commuting-oriented usage.

* High-traffic stations among casuals are prime locations for **ads and on-site campaigns** promoting membership upgrades.### 1. Trip Volume by User Type

* **Casuals:** High on **weekends**, growing weekday usage on **Mon/Wed**.
* **Friday** is a crossover day (almost equal share).

### 6. Average Ride Length by Day of Week

* **Casuals:**

  * Ride length and volume surge on **weekends**.
  * Slight decrease in ride length on **weekdays**, indicating more short-distance usage.
* **Members:**

  * Ride duration is **consistent throughout the week**, with no significant spikes or dips.
  * This pattern reflects **steady, utilitarian use**, unlike the weekend-oriented behavior of casuals.

### 7. Hourly Ride Patterns

* **Members peak:** 5–10 AM (commute).
* **Casuals peak:** 11 AM–4 PM (leisure).
* Both peak at 5–6 PM.

### 8. Average Ride Length by Hour

* **Members:** Constant \~12–13 minutes.
* **Casuals:** 25–35 min (2021–2023), down to 20–30 min in last 12 months.
* Sharp dip for casuals at 5–8 AM suggests possible **commuter overlap**.

### 9. Top Start Stations

* These can be used for **location-based promotions**.

* Clear segmentation of user types enables **precise marketing**.

* Leveraging behavioral insights = **higher conversion rate** to memberships.

* Increased member base leads to **greater profitability** and **user retention**.

## 🟩 Final Recommendations & Portfolio Summary

### Final Recommendations

1. **Promote memberships at key casual-heavy stations**:

   * Place large signage, QR codes, and exclusive on-site promotions at top locations like Streeter Dr & Grand Ave, Millennium Park, and DuSable Lake Shore Dr.
   * Run A/B-tested ad variants offering "first ride free as a member" or "weekend unlimited rides with membership" directly on station kiosks and in-app notifications.

2. **Launch weekend-focused offers for casual riders**:

   * Offer membership plans with strong weekend benefits — e.g. "Unlimited classic bike rides Sat–Sun" or "Weekend Explorer Plan".
   * Emphasize the convenience of unlocking any bike without repeat payments.

3. **Convert early-morning casual commuters**:

   * Identify casual users riding between 5–8 AM and target them with time-sensitive promotions (e.g. “Join before 9 AM today for 50% off first month”).
   * Market membership as a more reliable and cost-effective commute option for casuals who ride in the early morning — and also as a relaxing, flexible solution for longer weekend and evening leisure trips. Emphasize that membership benefits apply to both commuting and chill exploration, especially on classic bikes.

### Portfolio Summary
     This case study explored how casual and member riders use Cyclistic bikes differently. Using SQL queries, Python, behavioral segmentation, and R visual analysis, we identified conversion opportunities through ride patterns by time, duration, and location. Our strategy emphasizes tailored marketing to convert casual users into long-term members.
