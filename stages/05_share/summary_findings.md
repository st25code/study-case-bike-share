# Key Findings Summary

## 1. Trip Volume by User Type

The number of trips taken by **members** over the past 12 months is **almost twice as high** as the number of trips taken by **casual riders**.  
This pattern has been consistent from **2021 through 2023**: **members ride significantly more frequently** than casual users.

## 2. Average Ride Length by User Type

In contrast, the **average ride length** for **casual riders** is **approximately double** that of **members**.  
This trend has also remained stable from **2021 to 2023**.

### ➤ Interpretation

Casual riders tend to take **fewer trips**, but their rides are typically **much longer** — likely for leisure or recreational purposes.  
Members, on the other hand, take **frequent but shorter trips**, which suggests **commuting** or utility-based use.

This key behavioral difference is critical for designing effective strategies to **convert casual users into annual members**.


## 3. Trip Volume by Bike Type and User Type

The most popular vehicle by far is the **classic bike**, followed by the **electric bike**.  
The number of trips taken on **electric scooters** is **extremely low**, with only around **20,000 trips per year** for both casual riders and members.

This compares to a combined total of approximately **4 million trips per year** for bikes.

### ➤ Interpretation

**Electric scooters are equally unpopular** among both user types, indicating a lack of interest in this option.  
This suggests that future investments or marketing efforts should prioritize bikes, especially **classic bikes**, which dominate usage across all segments.

## 4. Average Ride Length by Bike Type and User Type

- For **electric bikes**, the average ride length is **similar** between casual riders and members — roughly **10 to 15 minutes**.
- For **classic bikes**, the difference is much more pronounced:  
  - **Casual riders** average around **29 minutes**  
  - **Members** average only **13 minutes**

### ➤ Interpretation

Casual riders strongly prefer **longer rides on classic bikes**. This highlights an opportunity to **incentivize casual users** by offering **special deals or benefits for long classic bike rides** if they upgrade to a membership.

## 5. Weekly Ride Patterns by User Type

- **Members** take more trips during **weekdays**, especially from **Monday to Thursday**, which suggests regular commuting or utility-based use.
- **Casual riders** are far more active on **weekends**, with peaks on **Saturday and Sunday** — this points to leisure-oriented riding behavior.
- On **Fridays**, there is a near-equal split between members and casual riders, showing a transition point between weekday and weekend behavior.
- A notable shift: in the **last 12 months**, casual riders began riding **more often on Mondays and Wednesdays**, compared to previous years when weekday usage was significantly lower.
- The **average ride length on weekdays has slightly decreased** for casual users, indicating more short-distance use during workdays.
- Meanwhile, **casual ride length and volume surge on weekends**, confirming their strong preference for leisure rides.
- In contrast, **members show consistent ride duration** across the entire week — and even experience a slight **drop in ride length on weekends**, reinforcing the utilitarian nature of their trips.

### ➤ Interpretation

Casual riders remain weekend-focused, but their growing weekday presence — especially for short trips — may indicate an evolving use case.  
**Members**, however, demonstrate a stable, commute-driven pattern throughout the week.

These observations clearly suggest that:
- **Members** primarily use their subscriptions for **functional purposes** such as commuting to work, school, or appointments.
- **Casual riders** treat the bike share program more as a **leisure activity**, favoring **longer rides on weekends** and likely using it to **relax outdoors** or explore the city.

This distinction is key when designing marketing strategies — highlighting **practical benefits for members**, and **leisure-oriented offers** for casual riders.

## 6. Hourly Ride Patterns by User Type

- From **5:00 AM to 10:00 AM**, **members ride significantly more often** than casual riders — likely corresponding with morning commuting hours.
- From **11:00 AM to 4:00 PM**, **casual riders dominate** usage, suggesting leisure rides during daytime hours.
- Both groups peak around **5:00–6:00 PM**, but members still show more structured patterns aligned with commuting.

This pattern has remained **very consistent between 2021–2023 and the last 12 months**, showing **no major behavioral shift** over time.

### ➤ Interpretation

The sharp difference in hourly usage reinforces the idea that:
- **Members** use the service mainly for **commuting**, starting early in the morning.
- **Casual riders** prefer **midday leisure rides**, likely in better daylight and weather conditions.

This segmentation could be used to time **targeted ads or push notifications** — for example:
- **Morning offers for members**
- **Midday engagement promos for casual users**

## 7. Average Ride Length by Hour of Day

- **Members** consistently maintain a short average ride length of **12–13 minutes** throughout the entire day, regardless of time.
- **Casual riders** tend to have much longer rides — historically ranging between **25–35 minutes** during 2021–2023.
- In the **last 12 months**, casual ride duration has slightly decreased to a range of **20–30 minutes**, suggesting a possible shift in behavior.
- However, there is a sharp dip in ride length for casuals between **5:00 AM and 8:00 AM**, aligning closely with member behavior.

### ➤ Interpretation

These early-morning short rides among casual users indicate that a **small but notable portion** of them may be using bike-share for **commuting**, similarly to members.  
This further supports the opportunity to **convert weekday-active casuals into members** by emphasizing value in short, regular weekday rides — especially in the **early morning window**.

This could encourage casual users to upgrade by attaching tangible, location-based value to membership.
