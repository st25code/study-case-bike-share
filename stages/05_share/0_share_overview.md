# Stage 5 — Share Overview

## 🎯 Goal of the Share Phase

The objective of the Share phase is to communicate the results of the analysis in a clear, professional, and impactful way. This step focuses on creating data visualizations and written summaries that highlight key insights and can support informed decision-making by stakeholders.

We aim to:
- Present findings that distinguish how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently.
- Support those findings with polished and effective visualizations.
- Prepare a presentation that communicates insights to the Cyclistic executive team with clarity and precision.

## 🧭 Alignment with the Case Study Business Task

- **Main question to answer:** How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
- **Business impact:** Help Cyclistic marketing team develop strategies to convert casual riders into annual members.
- **Audience:** Cyclistic executive team and marketing director Lily Moreno.
- **Requirements:** Create visualizations that are sophisticated, easy to understand, and highlight actionable insights.
